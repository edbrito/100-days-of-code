# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: 2018/04/24

**Today's Progress**: Decided to start the 100 days of code challenge. As suggested, I started messing around with Free Code Camp.

**Thoughts:** Done 45 "challenges". I'll finish the free code camp and then figure if I go to React, Node or Go.

### Day 1: 2018/04/25

**Today's Progress**: Continued on Free Code Camp. Also started the Backend Development Certification. This is my freecodecamp link: https://www.freecodecamp.org/edbrito

**Thoughts:** Ok, so by default Free Code Camp starts at the Frontend Development Certification. I decided to do 30 minutes of frontend and 30 minutes of backend each day. I'm already a SW Developer with some experience on both areas but I wish to improve upon them. I know that 100 days of code is dedicated to projects but I will start with the basics first and then start the challenges there.

### Day 2: 2018/04/26

**Today's Progress**: Advancing on the frontend and backend development certification

**Thoughts:** The frontend stuff is kind of trivial but some details are quite interesting. I've been doing backend for about two years but always in Java; doing stuff with Node is being fun.
