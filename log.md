# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: 2018/04/24

**Today's Progress**: Decided to start the 100 days of code challenge. As suggested, I started messing around with Free Code Camp.

**Thoughts:** Done 45 "challenges". I'll finish the free code camp and then figure if I go to React, Node or Go.

### Day 2: 2018/04/25

**Today's Progress**: Continued on Free Code Camp. Also started the Backend Development Certification. This is my freecodecamp link: https://www.freecodecamp.org/edbrito

**Thoughts:** Ok, so by default Free Code Camp starts at the Frontend Development Certification. I decided to do 30 minutes of frontend and 30 minutes of backend each day. I'm already a SW Developer with some experience on both areas but I wish to improve upon them. I know that 100 days of code is dedicated to projects but I will start with the basics first and then start the challenges there.

### Day 3: 2018/04/26

**Today's Progress**: Advancing on the frontend and backend development certification
https://www.freecodecamp.org/edbrito

**Thoughts:** The frontend stuff is kind of trivial but some details are quite interesting. I've been doing backend for about two years but always in Java; doing stuff with Node is being fun.

### Day 4: 2018/04/27

**Today's Progress**: Dedicated all of my time to the backend certification project. Finished some of the programming tasks for Node.

**Thoughts:** Node seems like great fun!

### Day 5: 2018/04/28

**Today's Progress**: Finished all the frontend certification part until the first project. Starting the ''tribute page'' project.

**Thoughts:** I think part of the difficulty is deciding on what to do the page. I have an idea, let's see how this pans out.

### Day 6: 2018/04/29

**Today's Progress**: Doing the "tribute" page for the Frontend certification of freeCodeCamp. Trying make it simple but still pretty. Hope to finish it tomorrow.

**Thoughts:** Not only do I need to think about the layout but also about the content. I have to collect some info.

### Day 7: 2018/04/30

**Today's Progress**: I was spending too much time on trying to collect info for the page insted of doing the tribute page. I'll consider the tribute page finished for and move to the next project.

**Thoughts:** I was spending too much time not doing real code. I think the next project will be better for coding.

### Day 8: 2018/05/02

**Today's Progress**: Moving on to the second "Basic Frontend Project", my portfolio page.

**Thoughts:** I don't have to think a lot about what to write in this webpage but I need to focus a little on the presentation. Not really a designer but a coder at heart so this is sometimes a little challenging.

### Day 9: 2018/05/03

**Today's Progress**: I think the "Personal Portfolio" frontend project is going ok; now it's more of a matter of adding content to it. I restarted doing the backend certification. Yup, Node is fun.

**Thoughts:** I think the backend part is going to be the best for me. Of course I need to improve my frontend skills, for professional reasons, but it's not the thing I like the most, that's for sure.

### Day 10: 2018/05/04

**Today's Progress**: Finished the Node.js and Express part of the Backend Certification! Next up is Git. Clarification: I already work with Git and with all the stuff from the Frontend Certification used until now but I want to improve those skills.

**Thoughts:** After working two years with Java, JAX-RS and Tomcat, working with something like Node and Express is like a breeze of fresh air. Wish I can use it for work in the future.

### Day 11: 2018/05/06

**Today's Progress**: Restarted the frontend certification on fcc. I decided to submit the portfolio page; it was just a matter of content. The javascript part is mostly boring and nothing new. I have to endure it to get to the fun parts.

**Thoughts:** I think tomorrow I can finish the javascript part with the basics and then I should work a little on the backend certification part with Git. Also probably nothing new but if I'm going to learn everything from scratch and solidify my knowledge then I should do it with everything.

### Day 12: 2018/05/07

**Today's Progress**: Started and finished the Git part of the backend certification. Getting ready for MongoDB. That should be nice. Also finished the Basic Javascript part of the frontend cert and started the OO and FP part of the cert.

**Thoughts:** I have used NoSQL databases before but never MongoDB. So, after this I will have some Node, Express and MongoDB knowledge. I hope that at the end of the 100 days I know more about React so that I have the full MERN stack under control. Let's see how long it takes to finish every part of the fcc certifications.

### Day 13: 2018/05/08

**Today's Progress**: Finished the OOP part of fcc frontend. Doing the Basic Algorithm scripting part.

**Thoughts:** A friend died today.
